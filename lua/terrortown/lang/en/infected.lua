If a player gets infected, they become a zombie and are able to infect other players. This allows the infected to build up a whole army.
However, there is one thing you need to keep in mind: If the host (the original, non-zombie infected player) dies or disconnects, all zombies will die.

If there is a Jester, feel free to infect them.]]
